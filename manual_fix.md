# Fixing the Bundle Install Error

After several attempts, it's clear that this Octopress site has dependencies that are challenging to install on modern systems. Here's a manual approach to fix the issue:

## Solution: Install Dependencies Directly

1. Install specific versions of Ruby gems manually:

```bash
# Install core dependencies manually
gem install rake -v '10.0.4'
gem install rdiscount -v '1.6.8'
gem install liquid -v '2.3.0'
gem install RedCloth -v '4.2.9'
gem install haml -v '3.1.8'
gem install compass -v '0.12.2'
gem install rubypants -v '0.2.0'
gem install stringex -v '1.4.0'
gem install sinatra -v '1.3.3'
```

2. Install a compatible version of yajl-ruby:

```bash
# Install newer version of yajl-ruby that works on modern Ruby
gem install yajl-ruby -v '1.4.3'
```

3. Try to generate the site directly with Rake:

```bash
# Try to generate the site directly
rake generate
```

## Alternative: Use GitHub Pages

Since this appears to be a GitHub Pages site, you can push your changes to GitHub and let GitHub handle the site generation for you. This is often the easiest approach for sites using older versions of Jekyll.

1. Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update site content"
```

2. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin master
```

## For Future Maintenance

For future updates to your site, consider:

1. Migrating to a newer version of Jekyll that's better supported on modern systems
2. Using GitHub Pages for hosting, which handles the build process for you
3. Using a Docker container with Ruby 1.9.3 specifically for building this site
4. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline that uses an older Ruby version

The compatibility issues are due to the age of the dependencies in this Octopress installation, which uses a very old version of Jekyll (0.12.x) that's not compatible with modern Ruby versions.
