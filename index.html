  <div class="entry-content"><p>How much time during the day do you spend on an internet browser? As a software engineer, my answer is a scary amount of time. Something I have personally struggled with is avoiding distracting sites on the internet. There is too much good content in the internet that dries up the finite amount of attention that we have.</p>

<p>Chrome has been my weapon of choice for browsing the web for a while now. Intuitive, clean and fast, Chrome&#8217;s ascent has been amazing to see over the past few years. Extensions on chrome allows addition of new features on Chrome made by third party developers. Lately, and there are a few extensions I simply cannot do without. When you need to buckle up and get something done, these extensions will help you get there.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>:
There are more interesting things to read on the internet for many lifetimes. Just like youtube&#8217;s watch it later, Pocket lets me save articles for future reading. With clients available for iOS and Android, articles saved can be accessed anywhere. At any time on social websites, be it facebook, quora or hacker news, there is a lot I would like to read. Pocket gives me the convenience to customize articles from the internet into my customized magazine.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en">Session Buddy</a> :
If you are like me, you context switch a lot between projects during a day. Chrome deals with tabs beautifully, and yet I find myself often with 20 or more tabs, lot of the times researching on a particular topic. Usually tabs follow a train of thought but fit within a particular context. Session buddy solves this exact problem, allowing me to save a set of tabs and windows which can be resumed later. For example, at the end of the day at work, I save a bunch of tabs, saved as the name of the project I was working on. This allows me to pick up from the chain of thought from when I left off. Switching between contexts is expensive, and session buddy is the best solution I have found.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>:
Holding myself accountable for how I spend time on the web has been eye-opening for me. RescueTime not only tracks how much time during a day you spend on distracting sites, but the desktop application also tracks your non browser time. Over time, it subtly moves you to try and improve your productivity score by avoiding distraction, thus getting more productive (Bravo on the gamification aspect, ResueTime team!) I have discovered patterns of my work through the tool as well, such as the benefits of taking regular breaks. It however, cannot track that even on productive sites, you can find ways to procrastinate. (I am looking at you, StackOverflow).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en">Block site</a>:
As much as tracking my time spent on the web helps, sometimes I need to simply block distracting sites. Block site makes for a great complement to RescueTime, allowing me to either visit whitelisted sites only or block off blacklisted sites. I have found my productivity levels on RescueTime spike when using block sites. Often its a reflex action for me to go to facebook or twitter without much thinking. Block sites counts such attempts, and shames you with clever 404 comments. I love that with the latest update, with one switch, you can turn off the distracting websites and focus on the task at hand.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>:
Despite the rise of alternative logins, passwords are still an integral part of the web. With a million sites, having passwords lying around can be rather dangerous. Remembering passwords is time consuming and difficult, adding frustration to the day. LastPass securely stores your passwords for various sites, syncing them across devices. This saves the need to browse through memory trying to dig up a password or worse, store them in flat files. It can also do auto login&#8217;s for your chosen sites. One of my favorite features is that it warns if you are using duplicate passwords for sites, making your web experience more secure.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome">Adblock Plus</a>:
Ok, this one is controversial. Adblock will stop advertisements on websites, keeping you focused and saving time particularly for video ads. Now, ads power the web, and any website with ads as primary revenue stream should be aware of adblock. I particularly enjoy the cat and mouse chase between youtube and adblock, youtube refusing to play videos as long as adblock is enabled, adblock gets smarter, youtube catches up. However, it can make certain sites load faster, thus saving time.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Angelhack looks for startups to come out of hackathons rather than just weekend hacks. As a result, it tends to get very product driven as teams compete for the Angelpad recognition. The theme this year was Apphack, and mobile apps were the key focus. Not really a surprise, as more and more startups build mobile first.</p>

<p>We worked on the verizon telematics data. <a href="http://www.verizontelematics.com/">Verizon telematics</a> is something I did not know about before. Car companies have been working with Verizon to install a device in the cars that could send data about speed, location, rpm, condition of the car in terms of last time since gas, particular model of car, wear and tear to the cloud. I expect Verizon is able to collect a lot more than the columns we saw. Needless to say, this would be a very powerful dataset and it is surprising that there aren&#8217;t more going on in this space.</p>

<p><a href="http://ipython.org/">iPython</a> and <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> are built for analyzing and visualizing tabular data like this. Questions such as which brand of car gave the best milage per gallon, which brand was driven more on the highway vs which was more popular on the city roads were fairly easy to answer. It was not clear if the data given to us was indeed an uniform sample, but results were interesting. However, they are hardly hackathon worthy ideas.</p>

<p>Needed an idea. One set of data had trip ids tied to driver ids, the other set had per trip latitudes and longitudes. Aggregating them somehow would be interesting. Geographical history of most visited places can be found since trips could be tied to drivers. Historical driving records could be obtained from individual trips and the overall history of the driver measured. Global driving records could be obtained so that the best driver&#8217;s can be found.</p>

<p>Once noting those features, the next step was to think how this would make sense as a product. Context sensitive software is hugely in demand and this is a great dataset for revealing patterns of drivers. Buisnesses aware of customers frequenting particular location can push deals and coupons to those individuals to drive buisness. Timeliness of visit can be used to fine tune the deals even more, e.g. lunch deals would make sense around the Grand Central area in NYC to a busy professional. The brand of car can be used to push vehicle specific ads. This would also be a treasure trove of information for car insurance companies figuring out insurance rates. Finally, it is quite possible that driving patterns can be used to trigger alert that may detect an accident ahead of time.</p>

<p>Its hard to argue that driving patterns are valuable data. However, as with any user specific information used for personalization experiences curated by businesses, privacy would be a big concern. It was not entirely clear who would own the data, the driver, the provider, or else. It should be made very clear to the driver of the nature of the tracking going on and how the data may be used. Since data like this could easily be used by a malicious third party to monitor you in real time when you are driving, there is inherent danger in it being available without the driver being informed. Tracking is an issue users of any clowd aware system needs to be aware of.</p>

<p>We did win the Verizon prize for the hackathon, and it was nice having our idea at the eleventh hour being well accepted. Angelhack put on a good show, and I must mention the apps &#8220;Make it Rain&#8221; (literally, on the phone screen) and &#8220;Kanye&#8221;(alerts if you are nearby Kanye West) for the hilarity during the presentation!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Online tracking has been a peak topic of debate this year and by the look of things will continue to be. NSA programs, Snowden and the reactions from top tech companies brought in more attention to tracking than ever before. It was hence very timely for Evidon/Ghostery to organize hack the trackers in early November.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a> is a chrome extension that displays trackers on a particular webpage. Not only that, they allow features to block particular trackers and include detailed information about the trackers. The emphasis seems to make web users aware of tracking and let them make the choice.</p>

<p>We built Falcon, which we thought would complement Ghostery&#8217;s offering quite well. Falcon is a chrome extension where we displayed the overall lost time due to the trackers and which trackers were the most resource intensive. Our hypothesis was that to increase awareness of online tracking, we needed to provide tangible ways in which tracking affects online browsing experience. Ghostery provided us with a data set with a lot of interesting information, among which average load time for trackers was a key indicator. Even with caching, users could lose time which would take to load the trackers, if trackers are loaded synchronously. This could particularly matter for mobile and locations with poor wi-fi as poorly created trackers would slow down the browsing experience.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/falcon.png" width="500" height="900" title="Falcon Demo" alt="Falcon Demo"></p>

<p>Building a chrome extension for a first time was not too complicated as it is very similar to building a web page and chrome is as reliable as platforms get. We ended up being one of the two semi finalists, the other being a cool way to link the trackers with their public figures as a fun way to raise attention to tracking.</p>

<p>This hackathon was particularly a great learning experience. Companies are taking highly innovative routes to glean more information about the users. Cookies have always existed, but two other forms of tracking I learnt was autocomplete fields tracking and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">browser fingerprinting</a>. Browser fingerprinting tries to get information from user-agent, the OS, extensions installed and other configurations to bind a particular browser to an user and this can happen completely on the server side. I have only learnt fairly recently about the bidding platforms for display advertisement and it was pretty interesting to see dictionary.com revealing on their console the bids as they happened in real time.</p>

<p>Computer security is a dynamic and fast changing field and this hackathon was an interesting mix of people in different niches of the industry. Tracking will continue to be an issue and it was good to see Ghostery taking the initiative to search for innovations in this space.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ran into this interesting problem lately and wanted to code up a recursive solution in Python. Essentially an extension of merge from merge sort but for intervals. There is definitely something very satisfying about coding up a recursive solution, as they tend to produce clean solutions despite the ugly formatting in this case to make list concatenation work.</p>

<p>How many people know their representatives for council/state/congress? How many local issues gets routed to the most relevant elected official? How do you know the status of the most relevant issues raised?</p>

<p>To solve some of these issues, we worked on the &#8220;Know your representatives&#8221; app during the Voting Information Project hackathon on 8/3/2013 to introduce elected officials to the public. It is a Windows phone app geared to increase accountability of elected officials which in turn will promote voter engagement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Users can view and contact their official and raise their issues to the respective elected official and raise the most significant issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Official can respond to uses and resolve the issues and update the status on the app.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can add their support to prioritize the high priority items by raising their support using the voting button.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Built and won the first prize at the big data hackathon at Alley NYC on July 26-27. The goal is to discover how many people are at a venue at a particular point in time and this app will try to do that for hackers, categorized by skills.</p>

<p>With more and more realtime data being available for the public, identifying knowledge clusters at the right point in time becomes really valuable. DevsNearMe is an Android app that attempts to combine data from popular realtime sharing websites such as FourSquare, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and MeetUp. It will attempts to predict users at a particular location by taking into account absolute numbers, and weighed prediction based on local context based information and learnt knowledge from past user behavior.</p>

<p>This could be highly useful for knowledge sharing, recruiting and demographic analysis. Prototype code is at https://github.com/DevsNearMe .</p>

<p>When I think of healthcare industry from a technical view, it seems like a story of regulations, walled gardens and aged systems. It remains a sector where tech really needs to deliver, and we are currently seeing a surge of start-ups such as Quantified Self taking on different issues. So when I stepped into the Northside Festival&#8217;s &#8220;Hacking Health&#8221;, I was not entirely sure what to expect. It was also an unusual hackathon in that the venues were different on two different days. All the pleasant surprise that we ended up winning the hackathon!</p>

<p>The project I ended up working on was definitely something I would want myself. I worked on PocketHealth, and the idea? Carry, check and transfer your medical information like you do a contact. The user can select care givers who can potentially have edit access to the history. But the kicker is in the UI. We worked on a facebook timeline like view for the history, and carrying and sharing your medical medication can be as easily as sharing a facebook profile. Although privacy would need to matter more than a facebook profile, specially with information that is by definition very personal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;This is not your ordinary hackathon. This is the big leagues&#8221;. Such was the claim of Angelhack this past weekend, and two weeks after participating in my first ever serious hackathon, I found myself at another one. There really is something about the mix of meeting cool people, hacking unfamiliar platforms and testing your coding chops in a small amount of time that can be quite addicting.</p>

<p>Shakere, the product I worked on, is an iPhone app for finding people based on skills or interests in social gatherings. Yes, your umpteenth social product, guilty as charged. The space for social discovery really is a heavily contested one, which made me hesitant at first since variants of the idea has been tried by many. I joined however, after realizing that the team would work well together (we actually had a UX designer in the team. Yay!) and this was my chance to experience iOS development, even though I would be developing the backend.</p>

<p>I worked on rolling a RESTful API (https://github.com/shakere/backend), working on the LAMP stack. Though I have not worked too much on LAMP backends before, I must admit that the stack is well suited for rapid prototyping. PHP in particular was a pleasant surprise to work with, in parts because of working with Perl for most of last year. I have had a little stint with Rails, and while Rails seems far more powerful, PHP is more explicit with less magic going on behind the scenes which makes it easier for starters to tinker. However, I did find myself handling quite a few inc files soon and was grepping to find which function was defined where. If I am working on a larger scale PHP project, it would definitely be worth looking into frameworks/best practices for PHP code organization.</p>
