  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I were to think about running a 26.2 mile race at the start of 2015, the overwhelming feeling would be one of fear. I have only ever ran a 10k before and just signed up for the Austin 2015 half Marathon, my first ever half. The prospect of running twice the distance still seemed far away though. Flash forward to October 18th 2015, I finished my first Marathon with a 3:49:00 time. As I look back on this year, I wanted to put together some of my realizations during the whole process. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Running is a privilege</strong>:
Living somewhere where I can run safely, have trails to run on, be in good health to run are all privileges to be thankful for. Growing up in the developing world meant that it was hard pressed to find opportunities to be involved in outdoor activites. Having the time and space to exercise is a luxury that needed to be earned. I never ran in high school, and by the time I graduated college I could not run longer than 5k. Having the time to run, being in US where running is very much part of the culture has been a huge contributor to my running progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joining a running group is one of the best decisions you can make as a beginning runner</strong>:
Training with people better than you to improve is not unique to running. Start of 2015, I had no plans of running a marathon. In April, I joined the Austin Runners Meetup (ARM). In training long runs with ARM, I was able to build up the endurance for longer runs which made the progression to a Marathon much easier mentally. Training with other runners can definitely help you maintain the habit of running as well as improve your form and performance. Moreover, I found a new community of great people which has been very rewarding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tying running with other activities you enjoy can make running much more consistent</strong>:
In Charles Duhigg&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X">Power of Habit</a>, he talks about the cue-action-reward pattern that most habits follow. Being aware of that pattern can help in building running as a habit. When run&#8217;s are followed by a delicious breakfast, you have something to look forward to. Trance music and podcasts help me maintain the flow during running. Travel is one of my favorite things and going to a new city for a race is something I eagerly look forward to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Running is a blissful release from life&#8217;s distractions</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing.” 
― Haruki Murakami, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&#8220;`</p></blockquote>

<p> Distractions are part and parcel of our lives as more form factors emerge competing for our limited attention span. Often, this results in us not being aware of the passage of time. Running has been a great antidote to that problem for me. When running is effortful, you have to concentrate on the activity at hand and your entire focus is on the present moment. Long runs offer the prospect of seeing places and neighborhoods that you would not frequent otherwise. A slight breeze on a scorching summer&#8217;s day has never been more enjoyable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Once running is a habit, a chore becomes a craving</strong>:
When you start out running, it can be something you dread on your calendar. There is really no way to get past this without sustained practice, lowering the cognitive load with group associations and reward mechanisms. If you continue though, you realize at one point that you start craving the runs. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it still requires a lot of mental effort to get up at 5:30am for that 20 mile run you need to do for Marathon training. But something about the combination of endorphins, habits built during running and seeing your friends out there on the trail can change running into something that you look forward to.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a problem.</p>

<p>It is fun to start side projects, but not always the easiest to stay committed and finish. Coffee has powered more projects than one can count. What also helps to stay focused and motivated is the company of like-minded individuals. Coffee and friends results in more and better products.</p>

<p>What can one do to reach more of those people?</p>

<p>Coworking spaces are hot in this economy. WeWork have recently stepped into the $10 billion club. In Austin, Capital Factory, Chicon collective, General Assembly and Link are just some of the spaces ranging from Accelerator/Incubator to just rentable office spaces. However, they are much more fitted for startups working out of a coworking space. Moreover, one spot can get boring pretty quickly.</p>

<p>What if you are a remote worker or work on side projects and wish there was a community you could cowork/share with?</p>

<p>In Austin, there are a few options for that as well. There is a great group called Cafe Bedouins who meet Tuesdays at 7pm in Houndstooth cafe to work on projects. I had a great time there, but thought why would this need to happen only on a particular weekday on a particular time? Weekends are often the times when side projects gets the attention anyway. By a stroke of luck, I ran into Adam Coulon at Cafe Bedouins, who is also really enthusiastic about coworking, and shared the same problem.</p>

<p>We considered platforms where people could spontaneously decide to meet and cowork on projects. Slack was the clear winner. It is really easy to set up, and it has spread like wildfire so people tend to be familiar with the product. Without futher ado we present <a href="http://www.coffeehousecoworkers.com/">Coffeehouse Coworkers</a>, made with <a href="https://github.com/rauchg/slackin">rauchg&#8217;s excellent slackin pluigin</a>. It&#8217;s a slack channel for people to find others and decide on places to cowork!</p>

<p>At the highest level, we love products and want their to be more finished products out there. It could be a blogpost, design concept, open source software or your consulting business. We think that better products happen in collaboration with like minded people. This may not be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea (or coffee rather), but our hope is to enable some people to optimize their workflow in a low commitment way.</p>

<p>If any of this interests you, join us at <a href="http://www.coffeehousecoworkers.com/">Coffeehouse Coworkers</a>. Right now, the members are mostly Austin based and in tech since that is our current demographic, but it does not really have to be limited to that. Austin is a great place to start since it has a lot of independent workers and great coffeeshops.</p>

<p>Happy coworking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second part of the two series blog post about my talk at PyCon Canada. Here is the <a href="http://aviadas.com/blog/2015/11/21/pycon-canada-2015-speaking-at-my-first-conference/">first part</a>.</p>

<h3>Proposal:</h3>

<p>Are you part of a team responsible for delivering cross platform products? End to end automated testing and communicating effectively are important when your project depends on multiple teams spread across functional domains. At Braintree/PayPal, we worked on a framework to reliably ship developer facing products. We will go over using BDD with Behave to describe test scenarios that speaks to both product and engineering, using Appium for mobile automation, and ElasicSearch and Kibana for storage and visualization of test results. You will see how the breadth of packages available on PyPI, the flexibility and ease of Python helped a team of developers whose core competencies were not in Python to collaborate on a common ground.</p>

<h3>Slides:</h3>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>High Level Takeaways</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you are giving a talk, too much content on slides means the audience is reading the slides instead of listening to you.</li>
<li>Design your talk expecting failure, and assume things like wifi will not work. An analogy would be the non functional escalator still being a staircase.</li>
<li>Show your talk to as many people as time allows. Every time I showed my talk to someone, I would find a new way to make the talk better.</li>
<li>It was amazing to hear from a 10 year old about his experience in coding. The barrier to entry to tech will keep falling in a noticeable way.</li>
<li>Teaching remains the best way to learn alongside with building things.</li>
<li>Coding for expectability is often as important as any considerations in a software project.</li>
<li>Science, data, web, systems and infrastructure were dominant themes at PyCon.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Getting to Toronto</h3>

<ul>
<li>It was really exciting to have my talk accepted at PyCon, since it was my first time speaking at a conference.</li>
<li>Getting through customs went as painless as they could have.</li>
<li>Toronto was colder than Austin, big surprise! Reminded me of times back in East Coast.</li>
<li>T-mobile data roaming was a breeze to set up, and worked mostly well across different providers.</li>
<li>Toronto had different modes of public transportation getting from downtown to airport: buses, streetcars, subway. Makes a city more interesting, although makes day to day travelling more complicated. Although, it does not take a whole lot to put public transportation in Austin to shame.</li>
<li>Asked a lady on the Subway for directions. It soon turned into a great conversation with her and her husband about life in Toronto and their experiences in US. For a big city, Toronto scores major points for having friendly people. Canadians have a reputation of being polite and helpful, and I would come to recognize it throughout my trip there.</li>
<li>My AirBnB was in Kensington Market, close to UoT where PyCon was taking place. It was a vibrant neighborhood, bars, restaurants, transportation nearby. My room was no hotel room, but a bed was all I needed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Saturday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Morning started with me feeling the stress of not having all my slides and examples ready. I wanted to take some time to reflect on the great feedback I got from my team, but there was little time left.</li>
<li>Adding to my anxiety was the wifi connection not working. Thankfully, some organizers helped me out. Once the certificate issues resolved, it worked well for remainder of the conference.</li>
<li>Continental breakfast consisted of an assortment of cottage cheese, granola/yogurt, muffins, bread and coffee. No complaints.</li>
<li>Talked to Dusty, a Facebook engineer working on the Facebook infrastructure in Portland. Having lived in Canada, he had a lot to share about his experience there.</li>
<li>Morning keynote explored the history of Python interpreters and went into benchmarks. Benchmark related conversations can get subjective, but the speaker did a good job avoiding that.</li>
<li>Talks on application security, Emmy nominated CGI(!) and Docker deployment followed. The CGI talk was offered a very different viewpoint in software problems. Being highly computation intensive and long life cycles means the tradeoffs are very different from the usual SASS app/consumer product.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Update: Udemy has generously granted a free coupon for the readers of this blog for their <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-and-understand-reactjs/learn/">React JS and Flux</a> course. Use the code <code>avidasreactjs</code> and the first 50 readers will get free access to the course!</p></blockquote>

<p>The importance of delivering realtime feedback to users is more than ever. Gone are the days when chats or games were the only applications of realtime software. Starting from finance, advertising or education, having a realtime component to your web application will elevate the user experience.</p>

<h3>Socket.io</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io&#8217;s homepage</a>, it is a library that enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It has two parts, a client side library that runs in the browser and a server side library for node.js. In recent times, this has become the de facto way of doing realtime web applications in the node.js world. Key reasons behind this has been the way it abstracts away the overhead of maintaining multiple protocols, while carrying on similar primitives from <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html">Node streams</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html">eventEmitter</a>. Some of its other powerful features include being able to stream Binary data, broadcast to multiple sockets and being able to manage connected client data from the server.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>The WebSocket protocol is a W3C standard that enables interactive communication between browser and server. It functions as an Upgrade request over HTTP 1.1. However, since all legacy browsers and devices do not have support for WebSockets, it&#8217;s cross-platform abilities get limited.</p>

<p>Socket.io itself is a library to build realtime applications. It will try to upgrade to and use the Websocket protocol if available. Socket.io depends on another libray called Engine.io which exposes a Websocket like API but provides fallbacks to other transport mechanisms such as XHR and JSONP polling. This enables application developers to write realtime codebases that are browser, device and transport implementation independent.</p>

<h3>Getting started with Socket.io</h3>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you have Node.js, npm and Express on your system.</p>

<p>In a directory create two files called index.html and app.js. In your app.js file, add the following</p>

<p> We create a new instance of socket.io and pass in the created express server as a parameter. As the server listens, whenever a new client starts a connection, we emit an event called server event and send the payload { foo : &#8216;bar&#8217; }. It also listens for &#8216;client event&#8217; and logs the payload once it gets the event.</p>

<p>It includes the client side socket io library. After instantiating a new connection, it listens for the &#8216;server event&#8217; and when that event happens it logs the data and emits &#8216;client event&#8217; and sends the payload { socket: &#8216;io&#8217;}.</p>

<p>Run node app.js and fire up localhost:8080 in your browser. On the terminal you should see { socket: &#8216;io&#8217; } and on the console you should see { foo : &#8216;bar&#8217; } printed out. Congrats, you just did your first Socket.io app!</p>

<h3>Useful Socket.io Concepts</h3>

<h5>Message sending/receiving</h5>

<p>Socket.IO allows you to emit and receive custom events. Besides connect, message and disconnect, you can emit custom events and send with associated payload. Emit and Broadcast are ways to send events and on is the event listener.</p>

<h5>Server vs Client API</h5>

<p>There are some common functions between server and client side, but it is worth looking into the docs and understanding what is possible on the server vs client. Generally, the server side has much more features and capabilites and is capable of creating rooms and namespaces but both sides and send and respond to events.</p>

<h5>Rooms and Namespaces</h5>

<p>Socket.io provides built in abstractions to demultiplex the connected clients. Namespaces, identified by a path, can be connected via the following</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//connects to default namespace &quot;/&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">admin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/admin&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//connects to the namespace specified by the path &quot;/path&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After a client connects with <code>var socket = io('/admin')</code> , we can send message only to the admin namespace.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">admin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;admin alert&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;website traffic is up!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//the event will only be sent to the clients who connected to the admin namespace</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This enables more role or other criteria based distribution of socket.io events/messages within your application.</p>

<p>Rooms provide a way to further divide up clients within individual namespaces. Clients within a namespace can join and leave a room. By default, a client always is connected to a room idenfied by the sockets id. Hence it is possible to send targeted messages to a connected client via <code>socket.broadcast.to(&lt;SOCKET.ID&gt;).emit('test', 'message')</code>. Rooms could make more sense for particular themes whereas namespaces seem to fit well for user type/responsibilities.</p>

<h3>React and Socket.io</h3>

<p>Now for the exciting part, integrating React.js and Socket.io into an application. React.js is Javascript UI framework from facebook. You can follow some of the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">initial docs</a> to get started with React. This tutorial will not go into great detail into the terminologies of React.js but refer to the official documentation if any of the React syntax looks confusing.</p>

<p>The basic idea of the app is to have an html input and a label. When someone types in something into the input box, it will update the label for anyone else who have an window open except for the person typing.</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>On the client side, two React components called Input and Label are created and mounted by calling React.render. Input renders an html input box which calls the <em>notifyServer method whenever the someone types into the input field. The </em>notifyServer method then emits socket.io event called &#8216;client event&#8217; with the value of the input box.</p>

<p>On the server side, when &#8216;client event&#8217; is received with the data, the server calls socket.broadcast.emit and passes the data payload along. This means that all the connected clients except for the socket that generated &#8216;client event&#8217; will receive the &#8216;update label&#8217; event and the payload. This sends the message to everyone except for the person typing.</p>

<p>Back to the client side, the Label component consists on a div with a h2 element with is set to the serverValue state of the component. <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#getinitialstate">getInitialState</a> sets the initial value to be &#8221; so initially the Label is empty. When &#8216;update label&#8217; is received, we call the _onUpdateLabel on label, which is an instance of Label. It sets the serverValue state of the Label component to data.value. This invokes the render method of the label component, and it generates a h2 header with the updated value of the serverValue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This has been happening at various meetups/hackathons/startup events sufficiently enough to warrant a blogpost. The situation is generally a variant of this, someone has an idea they are really convinced is the next big thing, the only thing stopping that from happening is making an app/website which requires a technical cofounder. The person with the idea is not at a position to afford the costs of hiring a full time/part time developer, so an equity sharing situation makes sense. Hackathons and tech meetups are where developers hang out, so approaching them there seem to be a good idea to find that cofounder.</p>

<p>There are a few problems to approaches like this. Software people who go to events like this gets pitched a fair amount, sometimes repeatedly on the same ideas. Also, we can be a rather cynical bunch, often as result of the kind of work that we do. This can result you not finding that engineer/hacker to build your app during a hackathon. Or they might do so during the hackathon, but simply drop off after.</p>

<p>It can get discouraging, specially if you are convinced about the idea and new to such events. Personally, I like idea people, specially because they bring in ideas from domains and problem spaces I would have no exposure to otherwise. Moreover, I also believe that cross-pollination of people from different groups is healthy and more products coming into the world is a good thing. Therefore, I would rather like to jot down some helpful tips which can maximize your chances of finding a technical cofounder next time you are looking for one.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Understand what motivates engineers</strong>: It&#8217;s important to understand what motivates engineers beyond just financial opportunity. If such an opportunity exists, you may be in pretty decent shape already and should really drill down on your exact plans on how the app would make money in the future. If you are less sure, there are still options. Can you prove that the app would have a broad user base? A great way to do this would be to prove that you have tried unscalable ways doing this already, be it door-to-door, personal know how, competitors etc. Most ideas can be validated using non-technical approaches. Knowing your problem space well will not only help you to build a business but also lend credibility when you are looking for a cofounder. Another thing that attracts is interesting technical problems or cutting-edge tech, so if your app involves either, it would be a positive. Good technical co founders can be extremely self-motivated once they realize that they have a problem is really worth spending time on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manage expectations</strong>: It is best to present the idea and the opportunity and not expect immediate commitment. Generally people are busy, but if you have done your homework and can present the problem well, there is always a good chance. Not all engineers want the same thing, and lot are perfectly happy working where they are. If you do not have a proven user base or revenue plan yet, it does involve a certain risk-taking to get on that journey. As someone who wants to be a founder, you should seek technical co-founders with the same risk appetite as you.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As a connoisseur of the web, front-end frameworks have been been a fertile area of late. React.js from Facebook has taken much fanfare, and this post evaluates key ideas on react, and digs into why you could be interested in React. Staying true to single responsibility principle, React is a highly useful tool if you are doing web programming.</p>

<p>In this post, we will dive into building a Frontend using React.js and Backend built using the Python framework Flask. Flask is a minimalistic framework, and excellent when your backend becomes more and more of an API. Moreover, this facilitates the microservices architecture, where the decoupling of your your app into small unit of services can make it more maintainable and scalable.</p>

<p>We will cover some of the key ideas of React and Flask here, but it would be worth referring to the official documentation for <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> for getting started and understanding the philosophies of each framework.</p>

<h3>Key Ideas of React</h3>

<p>The core idea of React is the developers are better of leaving manipulating the DOM to battle tested framework code. Since the DOM has a tree structure, finding elements and manipulating them would need many traversals of a potentially very large tree.  Instead, what you modify is a virtual DOM, and React runs its intelligent diffing algorithm to directly update the DOM.</p>

<h5>React</h5>

<p>React itself is the UI library that will manage all the DOM updates as data changes. It&#8217;s takes the V of MVC frameworks, hence it can be used with other MVC frameworks such as Angular, Backbone or Meteor. It is quite easy to use React to manage specific areas of your application&#8217;s UI, rather than the entire app.</p>

<h5>Virtual Dom</h5>

<p>The virtual Dom is an abstraction layer between nodes in the real DOM and the view of the code you are modifying. When React selectively renders subtrees of the nodes in DOM based upon state changes, it achieves the following</p>

<pre><code> 1. Ensures that your DOM is always up to date with current state
 2. Reduces the need to re-render the DOM every time there is change in state
 3. Updating only the individual components on state change ensures high performance
</code></pre>

<h5>JSX</h5>

<p>JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension and it brings in a HTML/XML like familiar syntax for defining a tree structure with attributes. This is the syntax you can use to declare the changes in layout code and React will update the UI. It&#8217;s a bold approach, since developers are conditioned to keep layout code separate from Javascript. We will explain more React terminology later as we dive into some code.</p>

<h3>Key Ideas of Flask</h3>

<p>Flask is a microframework, which means that it trades a short learning curve for fewer out of the box functionalities, compared to heavier frameworks such as Django or Rails. It gives developers more freedom to use their preferable tools and libraries. However, it does have a list of officially supported <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/">extensions</a> which when plugged in provide a wide breath of functionalities for a standard web app. Extensions behave as if they are native flask code.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you set up a <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/">virtualenv</a> for this project, and you may also want to check out <a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/">virtualenvwrapper</a> for convenience. This is to provide your app with a sandboxed environment.</p>

<h5>Getting up and running with Flask</h5>

<p>Lets first install Flask</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>pip install Flask

</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># For viewing and reusing app dependencies</span>
</span><span class='line'>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Set up the following directory structure in your app.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>├── README.md

</span><span class='line'>├── requirements.txt
</span><span class='line'>└── templates
</span><span class='line'>    └── index.html
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Modify your app.py code to include the following</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We start by importing Flask and creating a new instance of a flask application. In flask, app.route is used to describe the behavior when users hit particular endpoints in the application. Here when user hits the index route, we render a template called hello world. By default Flask uses the Jinja2 templating language, but you can use any other templating language. In fact, we will not be covering Jinja2 in this blog post. Finally we tell python to call the run method of the app when invoked as a main function.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s populate index.html with the following basic HTML boilerplate</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">&quot;en&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Flask React Tutorial<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;mount-point&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>         <span class="nt">&lt;p1&gt;</span>Hello world.<span class="nt">&lt;/p1&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now run the app with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>python app.py
</span><span class='line'>// * Running on http://127.0.0.0:5000/
</span><span class='line'>// * Restarting with reloader
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By default it runs on port 5000. Navigate to the endpoint and you should see the html page you just created. You are now up and running with Flask!</p>

<h5>Integrate React</h5>

<p>Easiest way to include React would be to just include them from a cdn. Let&#8217;s update the index.html to include React and and port our existing html to React. index.html will now look like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>For a more modular, maintainable Frontend</h4>

<p>As Single Page Applications gain in popularity, the size of front end codebases keeps growing rapidly. For keeping these codebases maintainable, modularity becomes a priority. The easier it is to modularize code, the more incentives developers will have for doing so. With the ease of modularity with CommonJS, npm has seen explosive growth of packages published which has helped the Node ecosystem greatly. Browserify brings that ease to client side development leveraging the CommonJS module system. When used with build tools such as Grunt or Gulp, you can write modular client side code just like you would write your server side Node code, and Browserify takes care of the bundling for you. There is much less excuse these days to make everything global and attach to the window object!</p>

<h4>Leveraging npm modules</h4>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/Modulecounts.jpg" width="800" height="670" title="Package Manager Traction" alt="Package Manager Traction"></p>

<p>Looking at the graph above is a big selling point when trying to evaluate the value Browserify can bring to your client side workflow. The graph is a comparison of the rate at which packages are getting published in different package managers Bower, PyPI, RubyGems. npm leads the pack easily. Recently, jQuery registry stopped accepting new plugins, with <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/111475741445/publishing-your-jquery-plugin-to-npm-the-quick">new packages being published on npm</a>. Cordova recently announced the same change, moving plugins to npm. npm is now hosting much broader range of modules than only server-side Node.js modules and Browserify can help you leverage these modules on the front-end. The flipside of this as a module publisher is that publishing modules on npm now gives you access to a much broader audience since people might use the module on the browser, custom hardware etc.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>In the CommonJS syntax, the &#8220;exports&#8221; object is the public API of a module and &#8220;require&#8221; can be used to include a module in your javascript file. Since browsers do not have require available, Browserify traverses the <a href="https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#how-browserify-works">dependency trees</a> of all the required modules, and bundles the dependencies into one self contained file that you can just include with a script tag on the browser. Browserify is aware of package.json and the order in which node_modules are resolved. Moreover, it supports built in Node modules e.g. path and gloabls e.g. Buffer so you have access of those in the client side as well.</p>

<h4>Transforms</h4>

<p>Core Browserify only bundles modules written in the CommonJS syntax, adhering to the single responsibility principle. However, there are other ways of modularizing client side code, AMD and Global Variables being the two usual ones. Instead of handling every possibly of modules, Browserify exposes a Transforms API so that a plugin can be built which can preprocess a file into Javascript in CommonJS syntax which Browserify can then consume. This means that you can write modular code just like your node codebases regardless of what module system your dependencies may adhere to. There are also lot of people writing in languages that compile into Javascript, such as CoffeeScript or TypeScript. To handle this, there are transforms available for AMD (deamdify), Bower modules (debowerify), globals (deglobalify), coffeescript(coffeeify), harmony (es6ify) etc. A simple search of Browserify on Github or npm brings up thousands of modules and attests to the <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/wiki/list-of-transforms">ecosystem around Browserify</a>. Delegating to transforms helps to keep the footprint of Browserify smaller, while makes it more extensible.</p>
