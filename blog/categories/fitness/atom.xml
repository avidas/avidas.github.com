    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran the NYC marathon this Sunday. On my fourth marathon, I was going for 3:45, came off with a 3:38, personal best by 4 minutes. More than the time, a vanity metric, I was happier about the race execution, doing negative splits, avoiding cramps and bonks/hitting the wall. NYC marathon is a technical and challenging course, but I found it could reward patience and training. It was also an emotional roller coaster for me, NYC being a focal point during majority of my time in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Training</strong></p>

<p>Big part of my marathon was made during the months prior. I have ran marathons before, most recently in Feburary in Austin, so I know my body is capable of handling trials of the 26.2. But I was carrying over my adductor injury from March, and since moving to NYC, its been a slow ramp back up on the miles. Joining the Dashing Whippets in NYC was a great decision, as all my running progress can be attributed to training with groups in Austin, Austin Runner's Club and Austin Runner's Meetup. Post June, I had to very patiently wait for my speed/endurance to catch up as I stopped running since March. Whippets are a great group, as they are both very competitive and large enough where runners of different paces can have others to run with.</p>

<p>Once summer turned into fall, I was beginning to get the mileage adaptation back up. Besides the Saturday long runs, I worked on Harlem hill repeats on Sundays and speed work with the Whippets on Thursdays. Putting those fast and hilly miles were instrumental to getting myself back into marathon shape. Alongside with Tuesday workout with the whippets, I was able to get my weekly mileage up to 55 early October, more than I'd ever done. However, at this point I had to cut back since the workload was triggering overuse injuries in calves and ankles.</p>

<p>This is what my peak weak mileage looked like</p>

<p>Saturday: 20m long run (Whippets)<br>
Sunday: 8-9m Harlem Hill repeats<br>
Monday: Rest<br>
Tuesday: 12m (Central park Whippets)<br>
Wednesday: 5m easy<br>
Thursday: 10-12m (Speed work on East Side with Whippets)<br>
Friday: Rest<br></p>

<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>

<p>NYC marathon has been my goal race, and I took nutrition and hydration leading to the race very seriously. Prior to race day, this involved hydrating well, drinking about 1.5 gallon of water a day. It also involved giving up alcohol for a month before the race. I remembered by cramps from salt depletion in the Austin marathon, and I added salt to my food leading to race and carried salted water with me on race day. I carb loaded leading to days prior to the race except before race day when I stuck to really simple food heavier in carbs, potatoes, sweat potatoes, eggs. On race morning, I got coffee and simple carbs such as oats, apple and a bagel/banana on the route. During the race, I used 4 Cliff Gels, one every 5 miles, an approach which worked well for me in Austin. On the race course, I alternated between water and gatorade every other mile. This helped me avoid cramps and hitting the wall during the race.</p>

<p><strong>Getting to start line</strong></p>

<p>NYC marathon is tough logistics wise, so I wanted to reduce chance of things going wrong as much as possible.  Race day is stressful, and I wanted to limit as much chances of variability. Spending the night on wall street gave me an extra hour of sleep and less subway stress en route to the ferry. Meeting up with friends I have been training with was also good to calm down race day nerves. The ferry ride set a tone as I was feeling excited and giddy with Statue of Liberty looming large in the mist. Waiting for the buses post ferry was more of a slog, with standing long being the last thing I wanted before the marathon. Off the bus, and post Porter Potty visits, I heard the announcement of my Corral being closed in 5 minutes. 5 minutes! I ran frantically to look and find my corral. Eventually I managed to get in just in time for my wave. That left half an hour of waiting for the race.</p>

<p>I dressed warm heading to staten island, and this was the time to get rid of the baggage and get some warmup in my system. I love talking to runners before races. In a race like the NYC Marathon, everyone I talked to had a super interesting story.</p>

<p><strong>The race</strong></p>

<p><strong>Staten Island</strong></p>

<p>For the first time, I decided to run a marathon without a pacer, phone or watch. I put trust in that my experience of running 3 marathons and training would be enough to run by feel for what Marathon effort should feel like. My goal was to be conservative for as long as possible as a course like NYC deserves respect and a cautious approach.</p>

<p>After the short opening ceremony, we finally took off. It immediately started drizzling rain, not ideal but not the worst either. My spirits were pretty high, despite everything, I was running the NYC Marathon! As we ran up the Verrazano Bridge, I wished for a clearer day as the iconic view of Manhattan from Verrazano was blurry in the fog. I brought my focus back to the road and the blue line markers, which mark the point to point 26.2 mile during the race.</p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn</strong></p>

<p>Downhill from the Verrazano, it was steep decline but not the time to speed. I checked my pace, letting most runners pass me by. We were gradually moving down the bridge towards Brooklyn, which could only mean one thing. Crowd support!</p>

<p>And what a crowd it was! Brooklyn was my favorite part of the race. They brought diversity, music, energy and smiles. Bay ridge leading to Park Slope, Flatbush and then running through Williamsburg was an absolute riot in the best way possible. There were times when if I spread out my hands I could reach spectators on both sides. Not a problem with such a well behaved and well wishing crowd. There were bands and choirs and some great signs: "You can overcome the path once you become the path itself".</p>

<p>NYC Marthon is a race of two halves. Most of the first half is in Brooklyn and is also has some of the easier parts of the course. My goal here was to run slightly under Marathon effort, and making sure to fuel/get water along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Queens</strong></p>

<p>Finally we were at the halfway point in the race, up top the Pulaski bridge. We heard the announcement that Shalane Flannagan just won the women's race and groups of people erupted into cheers. This set a great tone leading into Queens.</p>

<p>Queens does not get a lot of mileage but it is the lead up the most talked about part of the course, the infamous climb up the Queensboro bridge at mile 15.</p>

<p>This was a key part of the race for me. For the second half of the course, I wanted to start pushing, starting with uphills. Hence Queensboro was the acid test for how my marathon would shape up. While the ride up Queensboro was hard, I was passing people all the way which gave me a lot of confidence.</p>

<p><strong>Manhattan to Bronx</strong></p>

<p>As we ran down Queensboro, a low hum grew louder and finally erupted into cheers as we descended down Queensboro to reach Manhattan. The crowd here is bosterous and makes for a landmark momemt of running this race.</p>

<p>In Manhattan, going up 1st avenue, my priority was to still run at a fairly conservative pace as there was still 10+ miles left. Getting rid of my waistbelt at mile 16 was helpful as I got rid of some weight. The latter part of 1st avenue is surprisingly hard physiologically, as crowd support fell further into the course. This was also the part of the race where goals and training of the race starts to becone important.</p>

<p>Crossing the Willis bridge, we got to Bronx. I have ran this part of the course, and I was looking forward to the Whippets cheering section, which comes at the right at the edge of Bronx, at mile 21 as I moved my way back into Manhattan. It was at this point too that I was starting to realize not only I could break 3:45 but a PR was possible, which brought a fresh wave of motivation.</p>

<p><strong>Back to Manhattan towards central park</strong></p>

<p>Back into Manhattan, going across fifth avenue, this is where I started to increase to full effort, knowing that which each step, the course was getting more and more into familiar terratory. Despite that, mile 23 was likely the most challenging of the whole race, a steady incline up 5th avenue on tired legs. But this also where the training matters the most.</p>

<p>Once we entered Central park on 91st street, this was the home stretch. This is where I was really going for it, fixing my attention on one runner, catching up to them and repeating. I have ran central park enough to know the inclines and declines and with every step, it was getting closer to finish line. We were on mile 26 and at this point we left the park, run adjacent to it and finally come back. The last 400 yards were memorable, running through a painful haze but moving closer to that finish line and eventually reaching it. I knew I had PRed, I did not know by how much yet.</p>

<p><strong>Post Race thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Broadcasting to everyone how to track me on race day was motivating for me as I knew friends and family in NYC, Austin and Bangladesh would be watching. Ultimately, NYC being my goal race, I wanted to give everything I was capable of. 2017 NYC marathon was a race in which I was able to apply some of the race advice and strategies and this was the first time I'd ever hit negative splits in a race. It was really an unforgettable race, running with 50,000+ people and going through all the iconic NYC sights.</p>

    <id>http://avidas.github.com/blog/2016/02/09/10-things-i-learnt-going-from-10k-to-a-marathon-in-2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If I were to think about running a 26.2 mile race at the start of 2015, the overwhelming feeling would be one of fear. I have only ever ran a 10k before and just signed up for the Austin 2015 half Marathon, my first ever half. The prospect of running twice the distance still seemed far away though. Flash forward to October 18th 2015, I finished my first Marathon with a 3:49:00 time. As I look back on this year, I wanted to put together some of my realizations during the whole process. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Running is a privilege</strong>:
Living somewhere where I can run safely, have trails to run on, be in good health to run are all privileges to be thankful for. Growing up in the developing world meant that it was hard pressed to find opportunities to be involved in outdoor activites. Having the time and space to exercise is a luxury that needed to be earned. I never ran in high school, and by the time I graduated college I could not run longer than 5k. Having the time to run, being in US where running is very much part of the culture has been a huge contributor to my running progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joining a running group is one of the best decisions you can make as a beginning runner</strong>:
Training with people better than you to improve is not unique to running. Start of 2015, I had no plans of running a marathon. In April, I joined the Austin Runners Meetup (ARM). In training long runs with ARM, I was able to build up the endurance for longer runs which made the progression to a Marathon much easier mentally. Training with other runners can definitely help you maintain the habit of running as well as improve your form and performance. Moreover, I found a new community of great people which has been very rewarding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tying running with other activities you enjoy can make running much more consistent</strong>:
In Charles Duhigg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X">Power of Habit</a>, he talks about the cue-action-reward pattern that most habits follow. Being aware of that pattern can help in building running as a habit. When run's are followed by a delicious breakfast, you have something to look forward to. Trance music and podcasts help me maintain the flow during running. Travel is one of my favorite things and going to a new city for a race is something I eagerly look forward to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Running is a blissful release from life's distractions</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing.” 
― Haruki Murakami, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running```</p></blockquote>

<p> Distractions are part and parcel of our lives as more form factors emerge competing for our limited attention span. Often, this results in us not being aware of the passage of time. Running has been a great antidote to that problem for me. When running is effortful, you have to concentrate on the activity at hand and your entire focus is on the present moment. Long runs offer the prospect of seeing places and neighborhoods that you would not frequent otherwise. A slight breeze on a scorching summer's day has never been more enjoyable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Once running is a habit, a chore becomes a craving</strong>:
When you start out running, it can be something you dread on your calendar. There is really no way to get past this without sustained practice, lowering the cognitive load with group associations and reward mechanisms. If you continue though, you realize at one point that you start craving the runs. Don't get me wrong, it still requires a lot of mental effort to get up at 5:30am for that 20 mile run you need to do for Marathon training. But something about the combination of endorphins, habits built during running and seeing your friends out there on the trail can change running into something that you look forward to.</p></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>You only compete against your past self</strong>:
This can vary a lot based on personality, but being slower than a lot of other runners has never really bothered me that much. As long as I beat my previous PR by two seconds, I would be happy. Running as an activity has been such a positive change for my life that the gratification from being faster than others has not been necessary at all. Lot of people starting out running also worry about their pace. However, beginner runners should actually run slower than the pace they think they can run at to avoid injury and build up distance and time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respect your body's adjustment mechanisms</strong>:
One of my foremost running philosophies is to avoid injury. Running is a full body exercise. Your heart, muscles, ligaments and joints all need adjust to the increased level of physical activity. In the beginning, you run out of breath since your heart is simply not used to pumping out the necessary amount of oxygen to the muscles. However, it can adjust remarkably fast, and you may be tempted to run faster than you should. Getting past muscle cramps is often the next step. Your joints likely will be the last to adjust though, and care should be taken to not run too fast too soon to avoid injury.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hard things are often the most rewarding</strong>:
If a Marathon was easy, the feeling of achievement would be less profound. You will be in pain after finishing a Marathon. However, if there is any time when pain feels besides the point, this is it. Finishing a Marathon feels good in a way that is hard to find a parallel in our day to day life. Rather you feel as accomplished as a battle commander from the middle ages after winning a long and arduous war.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It will affect you positively in ways you may not expect</strong>:
When I talk to people about running, I consistently discover new and positive impacts running has had on their lives. For some people if is therapeutic and a great way to cope against troubles in life. It stands out as one of the activities that can have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 impact</a> on your life, since the improvement in concentration and physical ability that you gain from running regularly can help in most other areas of life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It gives you the satisfaction of reaching your goals and finishing</strong>:
There are lot of things in life that can drag on, get pushed on and not have a clear resolution. Life is rarely black or white. Running is often a refreshing break from all that. Once you finish a race, it is done and over with, offering the joy of finishing something. Moreover, looking forward and planning for the race can become an exciting activity, as you look to vindicate your hard hours of training.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Running is ultimately a very solitary activity. It does not matter if you train with a group, you are going to be on your own for long periods of time. This makes everyone's running journey very personaI. If you are starting out running in 2016 or have certain training goals, I wish you all the best. If you have already been running races, I hope there was still something useful in this post for you. Either way, feel free to reach out or leave a note. I would love to hear from you.</p>
