    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Besieged</em></p>

<p>That one word captures the reality of living in NYC during the Covid-19 pandemic. It feels like being surrounded by an invisible, encroaching army, with no end to the siege in sight.</p>

<p>Everyday we are exposed to terrible news, how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/nyregion/coronavirus-queens-corona-jackson-heights-elmhurst.html">immigrants are hurting in my beloved Jackson Heights neighborhood</a>, mass burial grounds either locally or abroad in Italy and China. Bustling businesses in NYC have been reduced to laying off hard working employees.</p>

<p>There is no how-to manual for this current crisis, so devastating and foreign to all of us. Despite that, resilience is human nature. If there's one place where our collective faiths have met, it is that better times are ahead. Is the thought of thriving during the age of Covid-19 heretical? It is perhaps more so to not attempt to.</p>

<p>Like many others, I have struggled with being quarantined in my apartment since March. I have immersed myself with the energy and drive that permeates NYC, and losing that has felt like being in withdrawal. At times, it has been a fearsome cocktail of loneliness, helplessness and concern.</p>

<p>I am a rational optimist. I like to think that better times can be ahead, but we have to strive towards it.  While my framework of life has been shaken by this crisis, it has yet to be broken, and it has definitely opened up more opportunities for self discovery.</p>

<p>Thanks to the internet, social media and on demand entertainment, simply passing time has stopped being a challenge. Rather, boredom has been a foreign concept to many of us surfing the world of dopamine rushes. Yet, deep inside, many of us feel that they fail to aid deep seated needs of purpose and self-actualization.</p>

<p>So how do we deal with our current consternation? Can we come out on the other side of this and be proud of what these last months meant for us? When we look back into this in five years, how will we think of this time?</p>

<p><strong>Invest in community</strong></p>

<p>It's more important than ever to be there for your friends and family. Deepening relationships with our closest people have a way of giving back to our lives. That could just be video chats, and I have noticed myself talking to my folks a lot more since this began. There was also one night when, after some silly games on the House Party app, I realized I haven't laughed this hard in a while and how necessary that was.</p>

<p><strong>Continue voting for your best self</strong></p>

<p>As the dust settled and I got more used to realizing that this is my life for the foreseeable future, I wanted to dig into things I could do but have been putting off due to the <strong>busy-ness</strong> of life. Not being as busy can be a positive thing, and opens up more time for things I have wanted to do more of.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Since Quarantine began, I have finished three books, and have enjoyed the process of being engrossed in a book more than usual, now that the usual societal stimulation has been removed. Using this time to read books I have been meaning to for a while has been enjoyable, accepting the mental escape that literature offers.</p>

<p>Cooking has added a lot of value to my life in the past, being able to create something nourishing that is beautiful and delicious is a very fulfilling act. I have been cooking more than I have been in a while and been really enjoying it. A good side effect of this is has been generally eating better since Quarantine.</p>

<p>Even before quarantine began, I have been coming off a challenging period in my life. Meditation has been the place I have been going to find center and grounding. It has also been fulfilling to keep a meditation streak of over 100 days and the reinforcement that just breathing can encapsulate all existence is powerful knowledge.</p>

<p>Life is not a scorecard, and the above activities are not things I do to achieve anything other than that I know my best self would enjoy. Even though they can be hard to start, they always make me feel better afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Use this as an opportunity for greater self-discovery</strong></p>

<p>If you are on your own, you can truly choose how to spend a lot of your time. For myself, this has revealed for me that I thrive when there is human connection. Quarantine meant physical proximity has not been an option, but it has made me think about the key allies in my life, reaching out, resulting often in deeper conversations.</p>

<p>Creativity is important to my life, but it is stifled unless there is a stable base. An organized desk, a clean room and decorating my room so I can see artifacts that remind myself of my best times are actions I have doubled down on. Sleeping more is another such act, and I have given myself the license to sleep as much as I need.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that self-actualization is the modern day superpower. As someone who has a long way to go on that journey, this is our time for digging  deep. Whether it is seeking internally via meditation or solo walks, or externally by reading or deep conversations, may this time help us on that journey.</p>

<p><strong>Pursue acts of spirituality</strong></p>

<p><blockquote><p>It's not something most human beings would give a moment of consideration to, that it is actually possible to be living for years in a state of constant betterment.  To consider that you are better today than you were yesterday or a year ago, and that you will be better still tomorrow or next week or at tournament time your senior year.  That if you're doing it right you are an organism constantly evolving toward some agreed-upon approximation of excellence.  Wouldn't that be at least one definition of a spiritual state?</p></p><p><ul><br/><li>Again to Carthage, John L. Parker, Jr</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>


<p>The above is an excerpt from one of my favorite passages of writing. It has really touched the cord on why running has been a constant in my life over the last six years. Movement and running is essential for me at a subliminal level, and pursuing it is more of an act of spirituality than chasing personal records, experiencing the spectacle of a Marathon Major or accumulating mileage.</p>

<p>When I mention the word spirituality, I mean those acts that you follow with conviction whether or not an ulterior motive is involved. I have noticed that dancing plays that role for a lot of people as well. Whether it is running, dance or prayer, pursuing them can water a deeper part of us.</p>

<p><strong>Practice self forgiveness</strong></p>

<p>It's important to not beat yourself over achieving goals, especially during this time. Comparing ourselves to a few selected people who achieved great acts of invention during times of trial is not a healthy activity.</p>

<p>In the same vein, there may be guilt which stems from the nagging feeling that you are not doing enough, that we could do more. It's wonderful how some of us have risen to the needs and led efforts for mask production, test kit distribution etc, but those are not the only ways to add value to others.</p>

<p>Where we will end up is unknown, but isn't that always the case? Existential threats and uncertainty can add a lot of suffering to our lives. Suffering is a side effect of being alive, but it is not where the goalpost is. Choosing to thrive in these times, taking actions that vote towards that direction and continue nurturing our deepest selves are some of the best things we can do in these times. I sincerely hope that manifests for you, dear reader.</p>

    <updated>2014-06-01T16:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://avidas.github.com/blog/2014/06/01/best-chrome-productivity-extensions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How much time during the day do you spend on an internet browser? As a software engineer, my answer is a scary amount of time. Something I have personally struggled with is avoiding distracting sites on the internet. There is too much good content on the internet that dries up my rather finite amount of attention.</p>

<p>Chrome has been my weapon of choice for browsing the web for a while now. Intuitive, clean and fast, Chrome's ascent has been amazing to see over the past few years. Extensions on chrome allow addition of new features on Chrome made by third party developers. Lately, and there are a few extensions I simply cannot do without. When you need to buckle up and get something done, these extensions will help you get there.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>:
There are enough interesting things to read on the internet for many lifetimes. Just like youtube's watch it later does for videos, Pocket lets me save articles for future reading. With clients available for iOS and Android, articles saved can be accessed anywhere. At any time on social websites, be it facebook, quora or hacker news, there is a lot I would like to read. Pocket gives me the convenience to customize articles from the internet into my customized feed or magazine via Flipboard integration.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en">Session Buddy</a> :
If you are like me, you context switch a lot between projects during a day. Chrome deals with tabs beautifully, and yet I find myself often with 20 or more tabs, usually researching a particular topic. Usually tabs follow a train of thought but fit within a particular context. Session buddy solves this exact problem, allowing me to save a set of tabs and windows which can be resumed later. For example, at the end of the day at work, I save a bunch of tabs, saved as the name of the project I was working on. This allows me to pick up from the chain of thought from when I left off. Switching between contexts is expensive, and session buddy is the best solution I have found.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>:
Holding myself accountable for how I spend time on the web has been eye-opening for me. RescueTime not only tracks how much time during a day you spend on distracting sites, but the desktop application also tracks your non browser time. Over time, it subtly moves you to try and improve your productivity score by avoiding distraction, thus getting more productive (Bravo on the gamification aspect, ResueTime team!) I have discovered patterns of my work through the tool as well, such as the benefits of taking regular breaks and how much standing desk really helps productivity. It however, cannot track that even on productive sites, you can find ways to procrastinate. (I am looking at you, StackOverflow).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en">Block site</a>:
As much as tracking my time spent on the web helps, sometimes I need to simply block distracting sites. Block site makes for a great complement to RescueTime, allowing me to either visit whitelisted sites only or block off blacklisted sites. I have found my productivity levels on RescueTime spike when using block sites. Often its a reflex action for me to go to facebook or twitter without much thinking. Block sites counts such attempts, and shames you with clever 404 comments. I love that with the latest update, with one switch, you can turn off the distracting websites and focus on the task at hand.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>:
Despite the rise of alternative logins, passwords are still integral parts of the web. With a million sites, having passwords lying around can be rather dangerous. Remembering passwords is time consuming and difficult, adding frustration to the day. LastPass securely stores your passwords for various sites, syncing them across devices. This saves the need to browse through memory trying to dig up a password or worse, store them in flat files. It can also do auto login's for your chosen sites. One of my favorite features is that it warns if you are using duplicate passwords for sites, making your web experience more secure.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome">Adblock Plus</a>:
Ok, this one is controversial. Adblock will stop advertisements on websites, keeping you focused and saving time particularly for video ads. Now, ads power the web, and any website with ads as primary revenue stream should be aware of adblock. I particularly enjoy the cat and mouse chase between youtube and adblock: youtube refusing to play videos as long as adblock is enabled, adblock gets smarter, youtube catches up. However, it can make certain sites load faster, thus saving time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Considering how valuable time is, it is important that we get done online what we meant to do. Hopefully, you have discovered an extension or two among this list that you were not aware of before and would help you save some extra time. The better Internet ADD is combated, the more time we spend doing what we love doing or be with family and friends and everybody wins.</p>

<p>This was a post about extensions, but there are certainly tools such as dropbox and evernote which are more than extensions and does boost productivity. If you think there was an extension or tool that I missed, please leave a comment and I would be sure to check it out!</p>
