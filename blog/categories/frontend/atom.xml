<p>Conferences are a great way to take pulse of the community, to see the problems the community is facing and how they are solving them. The relative newnewss of the React and Javascript community means that there are still many unsolved problems.</p>

<p>Community is JS core strengths.</p>

<p>I attended React Amsterdam April 10-12. I went to a workshop on Design Systems and GraphQL, went to a meetup and attended the day long conference.</p>

<p>The maturiong of tools around Design Systems <br/>
Design Systems maturing to bridge the gap between development and design.
JS is a tools heavy ecosystem, which is why looking under the covers is valuable.
Schema stiching
Code splitting
Next.js as dominant way to do SSR.
Apollo winning the graphql market
GraphQL dominant in the world of client side devs writing backend tooling
Lots of emphasis on gem</p>

<p>Encouragement to see the fundamentals Kent C Dodds. It's very relevant message for a community who can get anything they want by installing another npm package.</p>
