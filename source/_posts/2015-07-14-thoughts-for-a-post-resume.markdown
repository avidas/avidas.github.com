Here is my idea for a truly post resume, post recruiting industry model.

Companies break down projects into tasks that require particular skillset and expertise. Companies will bid a certain amount for a particular task.

Everyone is a consultant, but people can pool together to form a mutual fund like alliance (consulting firm), and they can sell fixed size chunks of their available bandwidth together or individually. Call it the ask price.

You can use a blockchain based protocol to verify the ownership of the skillset/experience promised by the individual/fund. Since everyone would have the ledger of past completed work.

Match is made automatically and you always know what you are working on, you don't need to care about who you are working for. (You could potentially whitelist/blacklist companies/institutions that you wouldn't work for -- terrorist orgs come to mind)

1. The resume needs to be deconstructed and smarter systems come into play mapping past expereinces and interests.

2. The financial sector have intelligently solved the problem of compartmentalizing assets into bite size chunks, combining resources to a level when often it is not necessary to understand what the underlying assets are.

3. In the future, there will be a lot more people acting as consultants or groups of consultants. Given the choice, people will prefer to work with the people they like, in the environment they like. Regardless of open spaces or cubicles, it's hard to make a large group of people happy. Smaller groups have better shot at choosing ideal environment.

(a person's willingness to spend his/her time to solve problems of companies is also an asset that can be split into bite size chunks, combined with other willing participant's time and effort) (location can be made irrelevant)

(separate tasks like specing, testing, qa, or have it together)

(people are much more likely to continue working in an environment they like, with the people they like

Disrupt recruiting with blockchain and stock exchanges

The global recruiting agency is a $400 billion industry according to Marc Andressen(link). Despite there being a lot of conversation lately about 

-- dependent on cold calling/emailing, resumes, 

-- inefficiency training vs turnover; 

(it may be in  high demand for people who can intelligently divide up the work so that it is long lasting, architects

I have had this thought playing around in my head for a while so I thought I would let it out into the wild. Ideas are hardly ever new, and likely someone have ran into this already. This idea is anything but bulletproof

blockchain -- blueprint for identity platform 
-- trustless transactional activity
-- no need for centralized arbiter of identity, third party
-- onename.io on top of namecoin


Missing component discovery for companies

1. verification of skill -- consulting companies where group of friends are already doing this.

2. culture fit -- let people have their own culture; people like working with their peers

3. assigning a value to work

I am not saying this model could replace existing recruitment industry any time in the near future, but it would be good to see its inception in some form.

matching based on the person's 


There's a lot of talk about how well 

IDEA -- 

I am sure this can be fine tuned more.

IDEA -- bitcoin protocol as a service /proving ownership as a service

PROBLEM -- for something like software, mainteinance, services ; solution -- like mutual funds, salary based system, 

PROBLEM -- non-trivial to test as requires both workers and payers to buy into the paradigm

PROBLEM -- very broad and open problem, hard to parcel into problems
