## [Your Infinite Life](https://www.yourinfinitelifeonline.com/)
#### Status: Live

Marketing website, CMS and course registration portal for life coaches built as a consultant. Was the solo developer on the project, worked with the client, project manager and designer to come up with milestones and deliverables.

In 2016, I was working primarily on the Rails/Postgres stack, and it made a great stack for a solo project. 

Biggest challenge here was being on the same page with my client on timelines, deliverables and working with designs which kept changing.

### Tech stack
- Ruby on Rails
- Postgres
- SASS and Bootstrap
- Jquery
- Braintree
- Mailgun
