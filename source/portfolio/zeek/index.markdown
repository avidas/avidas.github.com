Twitter Marketing Automaton - Generate High Quality Leads For Your Buisness

The primary insight behind Zeek was that we could analyze the graph of current followers and competitors to aquire better followers for a business twitter account.

As the lead on the project, I wanted to keep the tech stack narrow and use tools I was comfortable with to bring the product to market faster.

### Tech stack
- Node.js, Express, Gulp
- React, Bootstrap
- Mongo - Database for the user facing software.
- Python - Background jobs and utility scipts
- Redis - Used [Rq](http://python-rq.org/) as a simple task queue to process background jobs.
