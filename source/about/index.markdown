Hi, I am Avi and I am a software developer. I enjoy building things and learning new tools. On my most recent projects have worked on web backends in Python/Flask and Android. Creating an well designed app is exciting, but I also genuinely enjoy the engineering aspect of my profession such as optimization and tradeoffs. I am currently at PayPal, working on tbe platform SDK team.

Things I like: reading, running, lifting, hackathons, festivals, a good conversation.

Things that bug me: filling up forms, how little we know about the human body.
