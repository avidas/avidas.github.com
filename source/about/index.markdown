Experienced software engineer with 5+ years of experience building platform/apis/data infrastructure. Worked on various industries shaping the cutting edge of payments, financial data analytics, network infrastructure software and real estate.

For that reason, I enjoy learning about the industry and problems the buisness is facing. I do tend to work best with with partners who share the belief that engineers can be empowered to think like product owners and there is mutual respect for engineering as a craft and creating the environment in which it can thrive.
